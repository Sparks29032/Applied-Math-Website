A "vertex" is a point in space. We can draw a segment between two vertices <var>u</var> and <var>v</var>, (not necessarily distinct). 
This segment is called an "edge". If <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> are the same, the edge is called a "loop". 
Two edges that both have <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> as endpoints are considered "parallel edges". 

A "graph" is a collection of vertices and edges. "Simple graphs" are graphs without loops or parallel edges.
