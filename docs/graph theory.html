<h2>
Definitions
</h2>
A <b>vertex</b> is a point in space. We can draw a segment between two vertices <var>u</var> and <var>v</var>, (not necessarily distinct). 
This segment is called an <b>edge</b>. If <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> are the same, the edge is called a <b>loop</b>. 
Two edges that both have <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> as endpoints are considered <b>parallel edges</b>. 

A <b>graph</b> is a collection of vertices and edges. <b>Simple graphs</b> are graphs without loops or parallel edges. 

Graphs are <b>homeomorphically irreducible</b> when no vertex has two edges. This is because the structure of the graph is not changed if we remove vertices with two edges.

Two vertices on a graph are considered <b>connected</b> if there is a sequence of edges we can traverse to get from one vertex to the other.

The sequence of edges we traverse between two vertices is called a <b>path</b>.

If there is a path between any pair of vertices on a graph, that graph is considered <b>connected</b>. The <b>order</b> of a connected graph is how many vertices it has.

<b>Cycles</b> are paths from a vertex to itself with at least one edge traversed.

Graphs without cycles have special names. If they are connected, they are called <b>trees</b>. If they are not connected (disconnected), they are <b>forests</b>. 

Finally, let us define a notion of "equality" for graphs, known as <b>isomorphism</b>. In a hand-wavy sense, graphs are isomorphic if their edges connect vertices in the same way. 
We can call graphs <b>distinct</b> when they are not isomorphic to each other. 
The process for determining isomorphisms is a bit complicated: 
1) Check if the two graphs have the same amount of vertices. If they do not, they are distinct. 
2) Label the vertices of one graph <var>x_1, x_2, â€¦</var>

<h2>
Good Will Hunting Problem
</h2>
A pop-culture problem involving graph theory comes from <i>Good Will Hunting</i> where Professor Lambeau asks his students to 
"[d]raw all the [distinct] homeomorphically irreducible trees with [order] 10". Based on our definitions above, we should be able to solve this problem.



Though Professor Lambeau mentions the notorious difficulty of this problem, we can see after our exploration of graph theory that it is not so hard!
