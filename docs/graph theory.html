<h2>
Definitions
</h2>
A <b>vertex</b> is a point in space. We can draw a segment between two vertices <var>u</var> and <var>v</var>, (not necessarily distinct). 
This segment is called an <b>edge</b>. If <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> are the same, the edge is called a <b>loop</b>. 
Two edges that both have <var>u</var> and <var>v</var> as endpoints are considered <b>parallel</b>. 
Two edges sharing only a single endpoint are called <b>adjacent</b>.
A <b>graph</b> is a collection of vertices and edges. <b>Simple graphs</b> are graphs without loops or parallel edges. 
Graphs are <b>homeomorphically irreducible</b> when no vertex has two edges. This is because the structure of the graph is not changed if we remove vertices with two edges.
Two vertices on a graph are considered <b>connected</b> if there is a sequence of adjacent edges we can traverse to get from one vertex to the other.
The sequence of edges we traverse between two vertices is called a <b>path</b>.
If there is a path between any pair of vertices on a graph, that graph is considered <b>connected</b>. The <b>order</b> of a connected graph is how many vertices it has.
<b>Cycles</b> are paths from a vertex to itself with at least one edge traversed.
Graphs without cycles have special names. If they are connected, they are called <b>trees</b>. If they are not connected (disconnected), they are <b>forests</b>. 
Finally, let us define a notion of "equality" for graphs, known as <b>isomorphism</b>. In a hand-wavy sense, graphs are isomorphic if their edges connect vertices in the same way. 
We can call graphs <b>distinct</b> when they are not isomorphic to each other. 
The process for determining isomorphisms is a bit complicated:
<ol>
  <li>Check if the two graphs have the same amount of vertices. If they do not, they are distinct.</li>
  <li>Label each vertex in one graph <var>x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ...</var>. Then, try to pair each vertex <var>x<sub>i</sub></var> to a unique 
  vertex from the other graph <var>y<sub>i</sub></var> such that if <var>x<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>x<sub>j</sub></var> have an edge, so do 
  <var>y<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>y<sub>j</sub></var>. Similarly, if there is no edge between <var>x<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>x<sub>j</sub></var>, 
  then there is no edge between <var>y<sub>i</sub></var> and <var>y<sub>j</sub></var>. If no such pairing exist, the graphs are distinct.</li>
  <li>However, if such a pairing can be found, these graphs are isomorphic.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
Good Will Hunting Problem
</h2>
A pop-culture problem involving graph theory comes from <i>Good Will Hunting</i> where Professor Lambeau asks his students to 
"[d]raw all the [distinct] homeomorphically irreducible trees with [order] 10". Based on our definitions above, we should be able to solve this problem.



Though Professor Lambeau mentions the notorious difficulty of this problem, we can see after our exploration of graph theory that it is not so hard!

<h2>
Special Paths
</h2>
There are four particularly special types of paths. An <b>Eulerian path</b> is a path that uses every edge in a graph exactly once. 
Similarly, an <b>Eulerian cycle</b> is a cycle that uses every edge in a graph exactly once. 
A path where each vertex on the graph is an endpoint to exactly two edges is called a <b>Hamiltonian cycle</b>. 
Instead, a <b>Hamiltonian path</b> has two vertices as endpoints to exactly one edge while all the rest are endpoints to two. 
In both Eulerian paths and cycles, all edges of a graph are included in the path. 
In both Hamiltonian paths and cycles, all vertices are endpoints of edges on the path.
